This is a repository to display my first program which is a calendar

I am a Software Engineering Enthusiast because I never knew my mind until I programmed;
I consider programing a form of psychology because it exposes and teaches how the mind thinks. My first memory with programming is working on a calendar program for my first programming class back in 2018. From that experience I learned that computers are dumb—and I was even dumber for assuming that the computer knew what I wanted to accomplish; a computer does exactly what you tell it to do nothing more and nothing less, and if you do not communicate your thoughts in simple instructions, the program won’t work. This is why I am fascinated with the challenge of software engineering: I love to understand how my mind views and solves problems.
